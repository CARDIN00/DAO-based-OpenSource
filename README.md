#  Reputation-Based DAO Governance System
1. Task Proposal & Creation
DAO members can propose tasks via the GovernanceContract.
Tasks include:
Description
Budget
Deadline
Actions to execute upon completion.
Approved proposals are tracked and listed in the TaskManager contract.
2. Task Assignment
Developers apply for tasks through the TaskManager contract by staking tokens.
Assignment criteria include:
Reputation score (managed via the Reputation contract).
First-come-first-serve logic for specific tasks.
Once assigned, tasks are locked for the selected developer.
3. Development & Submission
Developers complete tasks and submit them via the completeTask function.
Funds for the task are securely held in escrow using the taskFunding contract until the task is reviewed and approved.
4. Review & Approval
Submissions are reviewed by DAO members or designated reviewers.
Review options:
Approve: Transferring the reward to the developer.
Reject: Reopening or reassigning the task for further work.
Supporting Systems
1. Reputation System
Developers earn reputation points for successful task completions.
Reputation is managed by the Reputation contract and is critical for:
Task eligibility.
Unlocking higher-paying and complex tasks.
2. Funding Mechanism
The Treasury contract handles DAO funds sourced from:
Member contributions.
Donations.
Potential revenue streams.
Funds for tasks are locked and disbursed via the taskFunding contract.
Governance
The GovernanceContract enables decentralized decision-making with:
Proposal creation.
Configurable voting mechanisms (e.g., token-weighted voting).
Members can vote on:
Task proposals.
DAO platform upgrades.
Fund allocation.
Transparency & Accountability
All transactions, proposals, and decisions are recorded on-chain for complete transparency.
Auditable events include:
Task creation (taskCreated).
Task approval/rejection (taskApprovedBy or taskRejected).
Fund management (FundsDeposited, FundsReleased).
Key Features
1. Milestone-Based Payments
Framework for splitting large tasks into smaller milestones.
Each milestone can have conditional payouts for incremental progress.
2. Anti-Collusion Mechanisms
Objective task assignment based on:
Reputation.
First-come-first-serve logic.
Potential for reputation decay to prevent monopolization.
3. Open Governance
Fair voting thresholds ensure equal participation.
Weighted voting mechanisms can be implemented based on reputation or token holdings.
